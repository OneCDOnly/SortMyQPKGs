* Minor update: (180320)
- Added [Entware] to the ALPHA list.

** Major update: (180224)
- Will not perform a sort when installing or updating this package. If another package is updated or installed at the same time, this could create a corrupt [qpkg.conf] file. To mitigate this risk, SortMyQPKGs will now only sort on shutdown, or when manually requested at the CLI.
- Added [AirSonic QMadSonic] to the ALPHA list.

* Minor update: (180221)
- Removed [DownloadStation] from the ALPHA list.
- Added [QSubSonic] to the ALPHA list.

- Includes input file list processing which allows for new features like line comments, comment lines and empty lines.
- Included list group headers for ALPHA & OMEGA.
- Slight reshuffle to group [HD_Station] with other virtual environments. Moved [nodejs nodejsv4 NodeJS ruby QRuby Go] to load before package installers.
- Record sort operations into NAS system log.

* Minor update: (180107)
- Added [QVPN VyprVPN] to the ALPHA list.
- Added [QHeadPhones Transmission QTransmission] to the OMEGA list.

* Minor update: (180105)
- Added [git Nginx PlexMediaServer] to the ALPHA list.
- Log is now trimmed so only the last 10 operations are kept. This will only work with recent SortMyQPKGs builds, but once a recent build has executed 10 times, log should look fine.
- Record package script version in log operations.
- Added a nice separator line to the beginning of each operation.
- Removed '#' char mark from display. We can already see which list a package belongs to.

* Minor update: (180104.1)
- Moved [SABnzbd QSabNZBdPlus] ahead of [Sonarr], so Sonarr can find an operational downloader as it starts.

* Minor update: (180104)
- Sort operations will now be prepended to the log (instead of appended), so the most recent will be shown first in the web GUI. This means the log will look a little bit odd for a while.
- Added [SickGear] to the OMEGA list.

* Minor update: (180102)
- Manual 'fix' operations are now logged.
- Removed the coloured display text during manual execution. Packages are now marked with a hash character "#" instead.

- Added [QSabNZBdPlus QSickBeard QSickRage MovieGrabber CouchPotato2 QCouchPotato Watcher3 Ombi Ombi3] to the OMEGA list.

** Major update: (171220)
- New package name! I've changed the package name from 'sort-my-qpkgs' to 'SortMyQPKGs'. Because the name has changed, your NAS should see this as a completely different package. This means all existing installations with the old name should be manually uninstalled, then the new package installed in it's place. Apologies - I chose to use the script name as the package name when creating the QPKG some time back, and I've regretted it ever since. This change finally corrects this error.
- Reverted (--fix|--pref) back to (fix|pref). It didn't make sense for these two ops to be the only ones requiring a prefix.

* Minor update: (171209)
- Changed the method used to backup qpkg.conf. The sorter now performs a 'logrotate'-like backup and only keeps the last 10 copies. All (qpkg.conf.prev) files will be removed.

* Minor update: (171207)
- Added [QNginx] to the ALPHA list.
- Fixed package finder so it only sees lines starting with '[' as a package name.

* Minor update: (171115)
- Added [Emby EmbyServer] to the ALPHA list.

* Minor update: (171022)
- Created this project on GitHub.

* Minor update: (171011)
- QPKG is now available in the QNAP Club store! Thanks to Stephane for the idea, and to Christophe from the QNAP Club for setting up the account.

* Minor update: (171010)
- Added [DotNET] to the ALPHA list.

* Minor update: (170624)
- Click the 'Open' button in the App Center to display the log file in a new web-page.
- Will now run an 'autofix' when first installed.

* Minor update: (170618)
- Small display fixes.
- Added [sort-my-qpkgs] to the end of the OMEGA list.
- Reintroduced parameter naming as (--fix|--pref) instead of (fix|pref).

** Major update: (170617)
- Changed from a script-only to a QPKG.

* Minor update: (170603)
- Display now uses Greek symbols to identify the installed packages. This should help if anyone has to post their display output on the forum (the displayed colours cannot be seen without screen-shots).
- Changed default action from fix to display-only. Use '--fix' to peform re-sorting.

* Minor update: (170602)
- Changed things a bit so that higher-level packages (with many dependent packages) like Entware, Mono and JDK are moved to the start of qpkg.conf. This should hopefully negate the need to specify all dependent packages individually.
- Various programming interpreters (Python, Perl, Ruby, etc...) will now launch early too.

* Initial release: (170601)
- First public script release.
